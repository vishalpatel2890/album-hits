# Classifying Songs as a Hit

### Motivation
Imagine you are a music producer with  a new album on your desk and a tight budget to market it. What songs should you put your limited dollars behind to promote as the "hit" songs? What songs are people going to find catchy enough to encourage them to buy the entire album? We wanted to create a model that could help identify which song(s) on a given album that would be the "hit(s)". 

### Data
#### Albums
We scraped names of songs and lyrics for the [top 200 albums of 2018](https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2018/top-billboard-200-albums) from [Genius](https://www.genius.com). For each song, we fetched data from Spotify's API to get music features (danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, valence, speechiness, acousticness, liveness).
