I see death around the corner And the U-turn signs lookin like a smile What do I do now? Who gon find me, how? Nowhere to turn but around and round Just another nigga that done lost his head No, a fucking king that forgot his crown I am not number one, its true Im number 9-27-82 Color blind even if I may be blue A lot on my plate, aint my favorite food But Im hungry, so hungry Need my family tree next to a money tree With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me I sip from the Fountain of Youth So if I die young, blame the juice Bury me in New Orleans Tombstone reads: \"Dont cry, stay tuned.\" Bring me back to life Got to lose a life just to have a life But if heavens as good as advertised I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife Rest in paradise Dont cry (Dont cry, dont cry), dont go (Why, oh why?) Wont lie, I fuckin love you Dont cry (Dont cry, dont cry, dont cry) Dont go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?) Wont lie (Dont cry, dont cry) I fuckin love you (Dont cry, dont cry) Talent is God-given, be grateful Fame is not a given, be humble And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully Stay in your own lane, seat buckled And sometimes when there is no music We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum That woman carried the future And Tunechi was born like, \"dun-dun-dun-dun-dun\" Dont call it a comeback It was dark, now the sun back Hit me hard, but I punched back The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap Is it suicide or its do or die? Its newer days and its bluer skies I told myself, \"Its just you and I\" Then the breeze came and it blew my mind Lord knows who Im there for I give my last breath of air for Mama tell me to be careful Voice in my head give me an earful But I got mind control over my control I lost control but knew Id find control I let God control what I cannot control Cant control the tears, let em drop and roll Dont cry (Dont cry, dont cry) Dont go (Why, oh why, oh why?) Wont lie (Dont cry), I fuckin love you (Triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife, rest in paradise) Dont cry (Dont cry, dont cry) Dont go (Why, oh why, oh why?) Wont lie, I fuckin love you (Dont cry) Dont cry, stay tuned And triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife Rest in paradise'"
